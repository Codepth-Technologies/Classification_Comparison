# Classification_Comparison
This is a project where we have compared Decision Trees, Random Forests and XGBoost Classifiers amongst themselves and with a Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network.

Two file are available in the GitHub Repo :
1.'datasets_glass.csv' is the Dataset. It contains several columns(features and target variable). Our aim is to predict the Type of the the Glass based on the values of different elements given suchh as Ca,Ni etc.
2.'classification_comparison.ipynb' is a Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for this project.
